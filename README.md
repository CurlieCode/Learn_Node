# App Overview: Recipe Finder Application

### Front end: Users will input ingredients, and the app will display recipes that match those ingredients. React will handle user inputs, API requests, and the display of recipe results.

### Back end: A Node.js server will store recipes in memory (a JavaScript array) and respond to requests based on the ingredients provided by the user.
